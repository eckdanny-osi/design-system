### Development

You have a few options. Select the workflow that most appropriately suits your context:

#### Storybook

> Great for developing components in isolation

To run _Storybook_:

```sh
yarn storybook
```

#### The Guide Site

> This is public docs site and reference implemenation. It runs on CRA@2.x.

To run the _Guide Site_:

```sh
yarn start
```
#### Contirbution guidelines

> Build a component under `libs/components/src` and export the component through index.js as

```js
export { Example } from './Example'
```

> For PO or designers to review the changes host it on storybook by adding Example story to components in modules under apps/www

```js
import Example from '!babel-loader!@mdx-js/loader!./modules/Example/Example.mdx'

const routes = {
  title: 'Component Library',
  path: '/components',
  component: Components,
  children: [
    {
      title: 'Example',
      path: '/Example',
      component: Example,
    },
  ]
}
```


#### rails_app

> This is a good integration check for our digital service teams that all utilize this stack.

To run the _rails app_:

first start the webpack dev server:

```sh
cd libs/rails_app
./bin/webpack-dev-server
```

> You may find it helpful to have two processes running for debugging via `pry` or for whatever. We suggest using multiple terminals/panes or using terminal multiplexer like `tmux`.

then start the rails server:

```sh
cd libs/rails_app
./bin/rails s
```
