Monorepo for CWDS design system

### Consuming the Component Library

_STOP!_ If you're just looking to start using `@cwds/components`, install from npm:

```sh
yarn add @cwds/components@alpha
```

Start using components in your application:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Button from '@cwds/components/lib/Button';

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <Button>Hello World!</Button>
  </div>
);
```

### Getting Started

Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ca-cwds/design-system.git && cd $_
lerna bootstrap
```

Run the component library build process:

```sh
cd packages/cwds-components
yarn build:watch
```

To run the _Guide Site_:

```sh
cd packages/design.cwds.io
yarn start
```

To run _Storybook_:

```sh
cd packages/cwds-components
yarn storybook
```

To run the \*rails app\*\*:

first start webpack:

```sh
cd rails_app
./bin/webpack-dev-server
```

then start the rails server:

```sh
cd rails_app
rails s
```

### TODOs

- [ ] globalize the functional css

### Development

I find [`tmux`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/tmux) very handy here because we're often dealing with _many_ processes in this monorepo. The big benefit of a monorepo set up is to have dependencies _linked_ so that you're always seeing early integration feedback when working on the CL. This project uses [`lerna`](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) and [`yarn workspaces`](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/)

To start up a pipeline for the component library itself (e.g.; watch and build styles, javascript, type definitions, etc.) you can:

`cd packages/cwds-components && yarn build:watch`

To see live changes in a downstream consumer app, there are two candidates:

The `rails_app` package is a `rails5 webpacker` setup that immitates the common setup for CWDS Digital Service teams. One can use the familiar methods to handle that: `rails s` (optionally running `./bin/webpack-dev-server` in a seperate shell) from the `rails_app` directory.

_or_

The `cwds.design.io` package is a static front-end build with `create-react-app`. This is [**the guide site**](https://distracted-dijkstra-a44525.netlify.com/) for the component library. Spin up the devserver with `yarn start` from the `design.cwds.io` package directory.

Both work. My pref is to use the guide site.

**Additionally** (since we're all about fast feedback loops) you can just use [`storybook`](https://storybook.js.org/). From the `cwds-components` package directory, run `yarn storybook`.
