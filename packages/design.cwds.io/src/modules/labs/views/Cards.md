### Cards

Cards are just white boxes...

A primary use of the `Card` component is to _group_ like chunks of information within a visual boundary.

There are many _subcomponents_ in the `Card` namespace. The top-level subcomponents (permitted children of the root `Card` component) include

* `Header`
* `Body`
* `Footer`

there are additional structural subcomponents intended to be used in `Card.Body`:

* `Card.Section`
* `Card.SectionGroup`
* `Card.Subsection`
* `Card.SubsectionGroup`
* `Card.Subtitle`
