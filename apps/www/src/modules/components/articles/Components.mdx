## About

You are browsing the CARES component docs. This resource is intended to help developers, designers, and stakeholders work together to build apps for CARES.

- Quick reference for visual patterns and components
- Component API documentation
- Usage recommendations
- Implementation guide for technical consumers
- Conversation starters!

The component-level docs are more specific and have higher precedence than the <Link to="/core-style">Core Style</Link> material.

## Components

Each CARES component intended direct use by Digital Service application developers is described in an article format.

### Structure

Each component article includes a general Synopsis, General Usage, Component property specifications, and a number of demonstrative examples.

### Documentation-Only Components

The entire guide is built with CARES components. There are however components present here that _are not_ part of the CARES design system and are meant to facilitate comprehension only. Those components are identified in the sections below.

#### DemoCard

Used to visually demonstrate a component in isolation from its surrounding supporting documentation.

<DemoCard>
  <Badge color="primary">Demo Badge</Badge>
</DemoCard>

#### Code Snippets

Used to provide technical reference implementation in small, narrowly scoped blocks.

```jsx
<Badge
  color="primary"
  onClick={() => alert("we dont need no stinking badges!")}
>
  Demo Badge
</Badge>
```

#### ReferenceCard

<ReferenceCard>

**Badge** starts with the letter "B"

</ReferenceCard>

#### Figure

<Figure src={img} caption="Figure" alt="cws-cares logo" />

## Errata

The guide site is **living documentation**. We're doing our best to provide accurate docs, but if you do find a bug, a typo, another error, or have other suggestions to improve the guide site please open an issue! Pertinent build information and helpful links for raising issues are available on the <Link to="/status">Status</Link> page.
