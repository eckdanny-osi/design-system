## About

You are browsing the CARES component docs. This resource is intended to help developers, designers, and stakeholders work together to build apps for CARES.

- Quick reference for visual patterns and components
- Component API documentation
- Design
- Implementation guide for technical consumers
- Conversation starters for ideation

The entire guide is built with CARES components. However you may encounter a few visual patterns that _are not_ part of the CARES design system and are meant to facilitate comprehension only. Those components are identified in the sections below.

#### DemoCard

Used to visually demonstrate a component in isolation from its surrounding supporting documentation.

<DemoCard>
  <Badge color="primary">Demo Badge</Badge>
</DemoCard>

#### Code Snippets

Used to provide technical reference implementation in small, narrowly scoped blocks.

```jsx
<Badge
  color="primary"
  onClick={() => alert('we dont need no stinking badges!')}
>
  Demo Badge
</Badge>
```

#### ReferenceCard

<ReferenceCard>alksdjf</ReferenceCard>
