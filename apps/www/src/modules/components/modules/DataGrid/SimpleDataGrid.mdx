For simple use cases _(e.g.; when only sorting and pagination are required)_, the `DataGrid` can provide an excellent means for quickly navigating collections.

Placement of a `DataGrid` inside a <Link to="/components/cards">`Card`</Link> is typical. `DataGrid`s may manage state regarding the sorting and pagination of records either client-side or server-side.

### Server-Side (preferred)

The general implementation of `DataGrid` shall use server-managed state. This is best suited for:

- large data sets
- highly time-variant data

In the server-managed implementation, each UI action which changes the sorting or paging criteria results in an API request for data which is ultimately rendered by the component. Because each _page_ of data is retrieved over the network (an asynchronous action), a _Loading ..._ message is overlayed while the request is in transit.

### Client-Side

For small (<mark>TODO: how small?</mark>) collections in which records are not especially time-variant, `client-side` state management techniques may be sufficient. Sorting and pagination state is managed by the component. Its simpler to use, but be sure that your use case permits it!
