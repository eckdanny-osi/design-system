## Synopsis

Use an `Alert` to communicate important and task-sensitive contextual messages from the system to user. `Alerts` provide feedback regarding the outcome of the users' intended interactions and operations.

<DemoCard>
  <Alert>Hello, I am an alert!</Alert>
</DemoCard>

```jsx
import { Alert } from '@cwds/components'
```

## Props

<PropTable docgen={Docgen.Alert} />

## Usage Guidelines

<Card><CardBody>

- Alerts must not be used for field level validation - see [Form Standards]() for this.
- Alerts should be placed at the top of a [`Card`]() or at the top of the [`PageBody`]().
- Error alerts must not be dismissible, so that a user always knows what they need to do to progress.
- Use Error Alerts must denote when an error exists that prevents a user from progressing (Ex: internet offline, 500 error when submitting).
- Warning, Info & Success alerts may be dismissible as it does not prevent a user from doing their work.
- Warning Alerts should be used when something important occurs, but does not prevent a user from progressing (Ex: Medium risk or safety levels)
- Info Alerts should be used to give users a heads up about something new or a change (Ex: new feature, notification)
- Success Alerts should be used for positive reinforcement after completing a task (Example: screening successfully created, form 100% complete)

### Accessibility

The `Alert` component places the aria live region role `alert` on the containing element.

See [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#alert) for additional information.

## Examples

`Alert`s take a `color` prop which should be one of the [thematic `color`]() values:

<Alert color="success">This is a success alert!</Alert>
<Alert color="danger">This is a danger alert!</Alert>
<Alert color="warning">This is a warning alert!</Alert>
<Alert color="info">This is an info alert!</Alert>

```jsx
<Alert color="success">This is a success alert!</Alert>
<Alert color="danger">This is a danger alert!</Alert>
<Alert color="warning">This is a warning alert!</Alert>
<Alert color="info">This is an info alert!</Alert>
```

### Dismissable

Passing the `toggle` prop enables the `Alert`'s dismissable behavior. The `isOpen` prop tracks state:

<DismissableAlertExample />

```jsx
<Alert toggle={() => toggleIsOpen())} isOpen={theIsOpenState}>
  I am dismissable! ...
</Alert>
```

### Uncontrolled

As a convenience to the developer, simple _dismissable_ behavior is possible with the `AlertUncontrolled` component (which merely wraps `Alert` and manages the `isOpen` state in a classical component):

<AlertUncontrolled color="warning">
  Check out this dismissable alert!
</AlertUncontrolled>

```jsx
<AlertUncontrolled color="warning">
  Check out this dismissable alert!
</AlertUncontrolled>
```
