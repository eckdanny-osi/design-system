import { Alert, AlertUncontrolled, Card } from '@cwds/components'
import DemoCard from '../../../../components/DemoCard'
import PropTable from '../../../../components/PropTable'
import Docgen from '../ReactDogenInfo.js'

## Synopsis

Use an `Alert` to deliver feedback to the user in an attention-grabbing way.

<DemoCard>
  <Alert>Hello, I am an alert!</Alert>
</DemoCard>

```jsx
import { Alert } from '@cwds/components'
```

## Props

<PropTable docgen={Docgen.Alert} />

## Usage Guidelines

- Alerts should not be used for field level validation - see invalid fields for this.
- Alerts should be placed at the top of a card or at the top of the page.
- Error alerts should never be dismissible, so that a user always knows what they need to do to progress.
- Use Error Alerts to denote when an error exists that prevents a user from progressing (Ex: internet offline, 500 error when submitting).
- Warning, Info & Success alerts can be dismissible as it does not prevent a user from doing their work.
- Use Warning Alerts for when something important occurs, but does not prevent a user from progressing (Ex: Medium risk or saftey levels)
- Use Info Alerts for giving users a heads up about something new or a change (Ex: new feature, notification)
- Use Success Alerts for positive reinforcement after completing a task (Example: screening successfully created, form 100% complete)
