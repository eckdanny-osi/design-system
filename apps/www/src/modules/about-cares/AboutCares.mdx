The overall purpose of the CARES application is to provide an easy-to-use, time-efficient, data-secure system to support users all across Child Welfare Services.

## Consider Your Audience: Worker, Supplemental Support, Youth/Family

A vital factor in achieving the application goals is being thoughtful and intentional about how the application speaks to different user audiences. Audiences are differentiated by the types of tasks they need to perform in CARES, as well as the types and tone of content they need to be provided to complete those tasks with confidence and accuracy.

### Primary audience: Worker

The initial CARES user audience for functionality is the “Worker”, meaning any Line Worker whose primary goals are to work directly with Clients to support them through the Child Welfare system. These users have the highest product usage, so CARES requires the most alignment to their needs.

#### Who are the Workers?

This user audience includes, but is not limited to, representing roles like:

- Screener
- Investigator
- RFA Worker
- License Programming Analyst (State Worker)
- State Attorneys (State Worker)
- Family Maintenance and Reunification Social Worker
- Vertical Case Social Worker
- Deputy Probation Officer
- ICWA Social Worker
- Dependency Investigation Social Worker (no narrative provided as of yet)
- Adoption Worker
- Eligibility Determination Worker
- Placement Worker

#### Workers’ state of mind

- "I always have more work than time to finish it."
- "Fieldwork took most of my energy today."
- "Every second I spend on admin work keeps children’s lives at risk."
- “Stop yelling at me!”

Also:

- "I am a longtime Child Welfare worker and adjusting to a new system is a challenge, even if it’s better than the old one."

or

- "I am a new Child Welfare worker and need to learn this system quickly."

#### Task areas

- Find Client information
- Enter new data
- Be alerted to progress/status
- Provide reports

#### Needs the CARES content voice to: _Remove my stress, rather than add to it._

- Treat me with respect, positivity, and gentleness
- Work with me, not over me
- Guide rather than berate
- Inform rather than blame
- Indicate an accurate level of urgency or importance
- Confirm my successes

### Secondary audience: Supplemental Support

We are keeping in mind the fact that Supplemental Support consists largely of supervisors/managers, administrators, and office support. These users are directly supporting Workers, from data entry to oversight to user mgmt., so they can require the same functionality as Workers, as well as functionality more unique to their job description, such as work assignments.

#### Who are Supplemental Support?

This user audience includes, but is not limited to, representing roles like:

- Clerical Worker
- County Administration (Identity Management, CWS/CMS SPOC)
- Intake Supervisor
- Investigation Supervisor
- License Programming Manager (State worker)
- RFA Supervisor
- Family Maintenance and Reunification Supervisor
- Family Maintenance and Reunification Manager
- CFT Facilitator
- Unit Clerk

#### Supplemental Support state of mind

- I have to make sure everyone else’s work was done correctly
- I have to track and prove my office’s/unit’s efficiency and compliance

or

- I just need to get this data into the system as accurately and quickly as possible

#### Task areas

Largely the same as the Worker, plus:

- Rapidly enter data
- Assign/re-assign workload
- Review and approve workflow decision points
- Monitor worker location and caseload
- Manage user access

#### Needs content voice to: _Be clear, specific, and proactive_

- Treat me with professionalism and respect
- Work with me, not over me
- Guide rather than berate
- Inform rather than blame
- Indicate an accurate level of urgency or importance
- Confirm my successes

### Tertiary audience: Youth/Family

CARES will eventually expand to include an external interface for current and former foster youth, and their birth, foster, and adoptive families to access their own information.
At that time we will conduct further user research to determine their functional and content needs.

## CARES’ Personality: The Assistant

From this research, a simple picture emerges: CARES needs to be an intelligent, supportive helper. CARES’ personality, therefore, can be characterized as the _best possible assistant_ a user could have. It will anticipate workers’ needs and smoothly capture, analyze, and present all the information and options necessary to quickly complete administrative tasks.
**Like any good assistant, CARES must be conscious of the emotional impact it has on the people it is assisting. Users need CARES to provide gentle encouragement and consistent indicators of progress in their mission to save and nurture these children’s lives.**
CWS workers are very aware that every minute spent on admin work will delay getting children to safety, ensuring their well-being, and improving their options for permanency. These users are carrying a heavy emotional burden on a daily basis, and may be experiencing secondary trauma from what they experience in the course of their workload.
Users should experience CARES as:

- **Professional** - Polite, respectful, domain-familiar
- **Efficient** - Quickly provides the correct information and options you need, when you need them. Direct without being confrontational.
- **Competent** - Provides the right feedback to confirm when you are on the right track, and direction to guide you when errors occur.
- **Reliable** - Provides consistent and accurate messaging in the right context.
- **Supportive** - Frames warnings and errors as opportunities for taking action and solving problems. Conversational without being overly casual.
- **Empathetic** - Respects the other stresses you are under and makes an effort to communicate with you in a friendly, respectful, and positive tone.
