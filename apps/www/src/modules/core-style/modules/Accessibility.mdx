## Accessibility

> Accessibility Means Comparable Access for the Public and State Employees

CWDS builds inclusive digital services so that people of any ability can access its services. Inclusive design benefits everyone by providing clear and easy to access experiences. CWDS Design meets requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act’s most recent guidelines (which as of Jan 18, 2017 incorporates WCAG 2.0 Level AA guidelines).

This includes (but is not limited to) ensuring visibility, keyboard navigability, language clarity, and screen reader compatibility.

### Implementing Accessibility Standards in CARES

CARES is defining a phased approach to accessibility compliance, beginning with an "MVP" to accessibility. This approach outlines an initial procedure supported by a set of testing tools to execute, track and document the procedure. Additionally, CARES has chosen to adopt the [Website Accessibility Requirements](http://dor.ca.gov/State-AB434/Website-Accessibility-Requirements/index.html) as outlined by Department of Rehabilitation. This includes activities captured under planning, assessment and remediation.

CARES accessibility policy supports the Information Technology Policy ensuring ensuring the public facing site/application is accessible to both the general public and that the internal Agency/state entity electronic and IT systems are accessible by state employees, including persons with disabilities as outlined in the State Administrative Manual (SAM) [4833 Information Technology Accessibility Policy](https://www.documents.dgs.ca.gov/sam/SamPrint/new/sam_master/sam_master_File/chap4800/4833.pdf).

#### Accessibility MVP for CARES - phase 1

Beyond MVP, we should be utilizing more manual test procedures and only relying on automated tools as a preliminary procedure.

- **Procedure** - initial assessment using automated tools
- **OS/Browsers** - Windows 7, 10, 11, - Mac OS X 10+ / IE 11, Edge, Safari 11, Firefox 16, Chrome 67+
- **Tools** - Capybara, WAVE, ChromeVox, Narrator, VoiceOver
- **Documentation** - We will utilize the comments in stories currently in JIRA as documentation. On stories that don't get completed before the code complete date, a comment should be added to the story so it will be accounted for and used as reference when new testing begins.

#### Post Accessibility MVP for CARES (CANS specific) - phase 1.5

This phase identified the current accessibility assessment toolset. The goal will be to begin aligning current toolset with the other digital services and establish a baseline to begin the process in Phase 2.

- **Procedure** - initial assessment using tools (Capybara + AXE), then conduct manual checks using NVDA screenreader, visual assessment and keyboard only tests.
- **OS/Browser** - IE 11 and Chrome
- **Documentation** - Utilize Jira for tracking and documentation. Official reports and broadcasts will be posted on this Wiki.

#### Post Accessibility MVP for CARES - phase 2

Focus on procedures and toolset that were recommended by DOR (Department of Rehabilitation) The goal will be to narrow the toolset, test OS and browsers, as well as focus more on manual accessibility testing only using automated tools as an initial assessment method.

- **Procedure** - initial assessment using tools (Capybara + WAVE), then conduct manual checks using NVDA screenreader, visual assessment and keyboard only tests.
- **OS/Browser** - IE 11 and Chrome
- **Tools** - Capybara, WAVE, NVDA, (JAWS is currently under procurement request) [NVDA How To Video](https://www.deque.com/blog/accessibility-testing-nvda-screenreader/)
- **Documentation** - Utilize Jira for tracking and documentation. Official reports and broadcasts will be posted on this Wiki.

### Design Strategy

1. All components of the CWDS Pattern Library meet accessibility requirements. Refer to the 18F Accessibility Guide Checklist.
2. Components combined together into page designs are tested holistically to ensure accessibility is maintained.
3. Regular usability testing is conducted with disabled users.
4. Any gaps in usability will be identified and corrected, or tagged with “accessibility-needs” in our product backlogs and prioritized.

### Communications Strategy

_Aligns with Department of Rehabilitation._ Collaborate with Comms for external communiaction.

Define the communication strategy and timely communicate the accessibility assessment results to all stakeholders, including, but not limited to:

- Executives
- Technical staff
- Accessibility Committee (if available)

Summarize and format the results so they are meaningful for the intended purpose and intended audience. For example, provide detailed reports for technical staff and a high level executive summary for executives.

Report the following in the detailed assessment results:

- Report Date
- Individuals or group that conducted the assessment- Include contact information
- Scope and/or sample - List every page evaluated
- A statement of conformance- Required for WCAG compliance
- Common or system wide issues
- Page-by-page issues
- Use case by use case issues
- Results from automated testing
- Recommendations or next steps
- Report the following in the Executive Summary

High level overview of findings

- Common or significant issues
- Recommendations for next steps & mitigation strategies
